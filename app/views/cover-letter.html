                        <p>
                            I'm very interested in the job offer that you're offering. Even though I'm not specifically
                            looking for a job, I ran into the offer just by coincidence and it caught my eye.
                            Since I've been planning to move to Zurich for quite a while now,
                            I was waiting for a great opportunity to come up.
                            I must say, I instantly felt enthusiastic and excited when I came across your job offer.
                        </p>

                        <p>I'm currently working as a full stack web developer at Ecrome Group AG in St. Gallen,
                            Switzerland. My tasks consist in maintaining and developing new features for the company's
                            web projects. For instance, I developed a mobile application called "Ja, Ich Will" for the
                            <em>Katholische Kirche Bistum St.Gallen</em>. I have also been involved in working
                            with new frameworks as AngularJs, Laravel and Ionic for hybrid mobile apps.
                        </p>
                        <p>My strong interest and passion for working in a sports-related sector roots in the past
                            position I held at WhiteBox Office in Almazora, Spain as a web developer and sub-project
                            manager. During my time there, I worked on very large and extensive projects such as the
                            re-launch of the new <em>LFP</em> website (Liga de FÃºtbol Profesional),
                            which won the Best Sport Website Award given away by the Spanish Ministry of Industry
                            in 2014. I also did maintenance work on the website of the
                            <em>Mutua Madrid Open de Tennis</em>, among other interesting projects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After finishing my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering I have gained a lot of
                            experience and curiosity for the latest and newest technologies. During the last three years
                            I have worked in different projects and had many opportunities to gain experience in
                            working with the latest technologies such as AngularJS, Jquery, HTML5, CSS3, PHP.
                            At the same time I was able to increase my experience developing in OOP using MVC frameworks
                            such as Laravel. Therefore, I think my curiosity and my experience could be very beneficial
                            for your company. I take great interest in constantly improving my skills.
                            One good example is my CV you'll find by <a ui-sref="cv">clicking here.</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I hope you enjoy my tailor-made CV I developed just this weekend using AngularJs and
                            Angular Material.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My work experience is mainly based on web development. Even though I have more experience in
                            PHP and JavaScript/Jquery, I also have some knowledge in Java, Groovey and Grails Framework
                            from what I've learned during my time as a student in University. I also have some knowledge
                            in C# and .Net framework thanks to classes I took back in Uni. Since you are looking for
                            employees that always strive to improve their skills and that have a passion for what they
                            do, I think I could easily fit in and adapt to your companies values and goals.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I feel that I could be a valuable asset to your international and dynamic team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hope you give me an opportunity to introduce myself to you in a job interview.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
                        </p>

                        <p>Kind regards,</p>

                        <p>Albert Gracia</p>
